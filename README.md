# CryptoViewer
The User Group we are targeting are people who want to get into the crypto market and our website is going	to be very beginner friendly. With just one click you can view the current market of cryptos with many crypto currencies. You can also add your favourite cryptos to your profiles and are able to see other people's favourite cryptos. Our website is very user friendly and gives you all the information needed about cryptos like the current price, market cap etc. 


This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
# what we have done
We have setup the basic framework code (e.g. the skeleton), we have done all the views ie the initial layout of our app. We are pretty much done with the design and we just need to add the datas from the api. We have tried to fetch the api and we are able to get the data from the api in the console and when updating the code while in localhost but we need to further
integrate that to our project. We also have deployed our website in firebase: https://cryptoviewer-3d8b5.web.app/home
https://cryptoviewer-3d8b5.firebaseapp.com/home. 

Things that are left to do are: 
*corretly fetch the api and get correct datas. 
*Can see others favorite cryptos.
*Make an account and add your favotite cryptos. 

In our src/router folder: We have diffrent directories to our view file so if you click in home, it will show home page file and when you click in users it will show the users file.  

In our src/view mapp: We have all the view files that gets displayed to the users. We have a home view file that shows the struture of our home file and what it contains. 

In src/app.vue file: We have defined the whole sturture of our app. 

In src/cryptoSource: we have sample code for connecting with the api.
